;Comments:	Please respect the modeller and contact him if you would like to include this mod into your own.  Precious hours that he could have used to watch the last episodes of "Lost" were put into this.  Remember that what comes around, goes around.  Feel free to modify the .ply and textures for your own personal use.  All textures were found on the Net, public domain, AFAIK.  Comments welcome.  Have fun!
